NDecorate
=====

Enables composition of multi-functional types using the decorator pattern without requiring constructor injection or a concrete inheritance chain.

NDecorate improves the flexibility of your app and helps you localize and minimize type responsibility.

A [2004 article on NHibernate](http://www.theserverside.net/tt/articles/showarticle.tss?id=NHibernate) espouses the reason for NDecorate very well:

 > Last month, Bruce Tate and I released a new book called “Better, Faster, Lighter Java”. Don’t let that “j” word in the title throw you too much; the principles we espouse in the book are equally applicable to any modern development platform. One of those principles is transparency; the key to any enterprise application is the domain model. These are the classes that model, and solve, your customers’ business problems. If you customer is a bank, your domain model is filled with Accounts, Deposits and Loans. If your customer is a travel agent, your domain is filled with Tours and Hotels and Airlines. It is in these classes that your customers’ problems are addressed; everything else is just a service to support the domain. I mean things like data storage, message transport, transactional control, etc. As much as possible, you want those services to be transparent to your domain model. Transparency means that your model benefits from those services without being modified by them. It shouldn’t require special code in your domain to utilize those services, it shouldn’t require specific containers, or interfaces to implement. Which means that your domain architecture can be 100% focused on the business problem at hand, not technical problems outside the business. A side effect of achieving transparency is that you can replace services with alternate providers or add new services without changing your domain.

If NDecorate helps you or your team develop great software please [let me know](mailto:ben@bj.ma "Ben's email address")! It will help motivate me to develop and improve NDecorate.


Example
=====

```C#

//this object has normal functionality
var objectToDecorate = new MyType();
  
//decoratedObject has normal functionality, plus client-transparent caching and logging capability
var decoratedObject = objectToDecorate.Decorate<IMyQuery>(new [] { new CacheDecorator(), new LogDecorator() });

```

How to use
=====

**1. Define a base type for decorating:**

```C#
 
public interface IMyType : IDecorator<IMyType>
{
	void DoSomething();
}
 
```

**2. Define your type to be decorated:**

```C#

public class MyTypeToDecorate : IMyType
{
	public void DoSomething() {
		//do something...
	}
 
	public IQueryTypeA DecoratorTarget { get; set; }
}
  
```

**3. In your config:**

NOTE: configuration transforms may be used to achieve different default behavior for different builds or environments. 

```XML

<configSections>
	<section name="features" type="NFeature.Configuration.FeatureConfigurationSection`1[[NDecorate.Test.Fast.Feature, NDecorate.Test.Fast]], NFeature.Configuration" />
</configSections>
<features>
	<add name="NDecorate" settings="{ 
		'DecoratorTypeAliases': [ { Alias: 'Cache', Type: 'CacheDecorator, MyAssembly' }, 
								  { Alias: 'Log', Type: 'LogDecorator, MyAssembly' } ], 
		'MyTypeToDecorate, MyAssembly': [ 'Cache', 'Log' ] }" />
</features>

````

**4. Define your decorators:**

```C#

public class LogDecorator : IMyType
{
	public void DoSomething() {
 		//some logging logic...
  
		return DecoratorTarget.DoSomething();
	}

	public IMyType DecoratorTarget { get; set; }
}

public class CacheDecorator : IMyType
{
	public void DoSomething() {
		//some caching logic...
   
		return DecoratorTarget.DoSomething();
	}
	
	public IMyType DecoratorTarget { get; set; }
}

```

**5. Decorate your type:**

```C#

//IContext is the service locator context; decoratorTypeNames are retrieved from the config file
var myDecoratedType = query.Decorate(DecoratorHelpers.GetDecoratorsFor<IMyType, IContext>(serviceLocator, decoratorTypeNames));

```

**6. Use your type:**

```C#

myDecoratedType.DoSomething(); //something is done, together with the transparent execution of some caching and logging logic

```
